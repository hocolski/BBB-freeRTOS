The bmpToRaster converts a BMP image to a header file with raw information.
For 480x800 images, the generated header file will be compressed one.

Compression:
In the generated file,
The three Least Significant Bytes will indicate the pixel value. 
The Most Significant Byte of a word will indicate the number of times the pixel repeats
in the image. This is only valid if the number is <256.
If the number is >255, the number of pixels will be stored in the next WORD.
Eg: If pixel value AABBCC is repeated 8 times, then PPQQRR is repeated for 10000 times,
The generated file would contain the following representation for pixel values. 
0x08AABBCC, 0xPQQRR, 0x2710


Steps For Getting the header file:

Step 1: Build the application using 'make' command
$make

Step 2: Get .h file from a .bmp file.
$./a.out <No.of ROWS> <No.of Columns> <Source File Name> <Destination File name> <image format required 565/24><pixel odering RGB/BGR>
